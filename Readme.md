# NextGram

This is a sample Next.js application that takes advantage of the advanced routing capabilities.

The photo route can be attached to _two distinct_ components:

1. When navigating within the application, it is rendered as a modal
2. When the page is refreshed, it is rendered as a standalone page

## Versions
